now the chnage in js are :
we dont have to fully increase or decrease heights quantities in all 3 bottles
now i wnated to do like
u can see there is already balls are being generated in 3 different batches....
i dont wanna chnage id="h2-quantity-1" related things...
i wanted to change both id="h2-quantity-2" and id="=o2-quantity-1"
in these both should be start and end at below conditions:
when batch 3 balls are generated at that time i wanted to start decreasing id="o2-quantity-1"
now we dont have to completely fill or empty bottles.... instead we can do like
when batch 3 starts at that moment start decresing #o2-quantity-1 and if animation starts again like firstbatch again started if user changes the value of input range
then animations will start from 0 first batch ...then stop decreasing #o2-quantity-1 until third batch starts... and if clicked on resetbtn or animations resets then starts again from starting...
same thing with h2-quantity-2
